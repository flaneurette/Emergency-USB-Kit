# EMERGENCY USB STICK.

> Your ISO files here.

`EMERGENCY-IMG.img` is a special bootable image for Ventoy, it is comprised of a tiny Linux version with just the kernel and a few packages. When selected in Ventoy, it can read the entire USB stick. This gives you access to the stick, to read files in case the other ISO's won't work, or if someone is not used to consoles and terminals. In this way, all README.md files are readable without having to know commandline.

Note that `E-USB.conf` must exist in the root, wihtout it, it will not boot.
