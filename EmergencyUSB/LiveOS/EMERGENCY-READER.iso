# Placeholder for emergency reader ISO based on Alpine Linux.
# This ISO will boot a C program that can read all documents on the stick.
# It is designed for users unfamiliar with Linux or terminals.
# The reader provides access to all README files, texts, and critical documents.
# Serves as a last-resort failsafe if nothing else boots.
# Updates and improvements coming soon.

# The C program will require the E-USB.conf file in the root of the USB stick. 
# It must be on the USB stick for the reader to work correctly.
