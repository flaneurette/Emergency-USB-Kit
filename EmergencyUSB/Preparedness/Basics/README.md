# Practical Advice

Always follow your governmental advisory first, use this only if there is no advisory.
  
### 1. Rubble Survival - Safely Navigate Collapsed Buildings

Do not ignore an "air alert" siren or government text message. Follow instructions, or get out and go to shelter. (does not apply to nuclear attacks)

* Calm down, rescue crews need time to asses.
* Do not try to move rubble nor diassemble things.
* Do not move ceilings or beams
* Assess before moving: Look for stable paths, avoid leaning walls and hanging debris.
* Move slowly and deliberately: Test each step; avoid sudden shifts that may trigger collapses.
* Protect head and limbs: Use helmet, thick clothing, or even improvised padding.
* Signal safely: If trapped, make noise or use a whistle or wave bright cloth; avoid shouting excessively (fatigue).
* Mark paths: Leave breadcrumbs or marks to find your way back.
* Do not use matches or lighters, this may cause explosion (gas leak)
* Rescuers sometimes arrange a minute of silence, use this to shout as loud as possible if you hear no noise for 20-30 seconds.
* If near pipes, tick against it so you can be found.
* If you can get out, examine yourself for wounds.

### 2. Nuclear / Chemical Attacks - Protection & Dos / Don’ts

**If you look outside and notice a bright flash, immediately look away. Do not look at it again, as it might burn your eyes permanently and cause blindness**

- If in a car: close doors and windows instantly.
- If outside: find a recess and lie down flat, hands under your body.
- Cover your mouth and nose with a (gas) mask, or cloth. Breath through it.

* Shelter immediately: Go to the innermost part of a building, ideally underground or without windows.
* Seal gaps: Close doors, windows, vents, and cover cracks with tape or wet cloths.
* Limit exposure: Stay indoors, avoid smoke, dust, or fallout.
* Decontaminate: Remove clothing, wash exposed skin thoroughly if contaminated.
* Stay informed: Use a battery-powered radio or offline-prepared alerts.
* Take shower if possible
* You can use **tapwater** to clean yourself, but **do not drink** it unless the government says so. (only drink tapwater if there is a great risk of dehydration)
* Use bottled water first.

Chemicals:

If possible, create distance, but only if it's safe to do so. Especially when **chemicals or gasses** are involved. Chemical/gas attacks may seep into all buildings within seconds to minutes, even sealed and high-rise ones, so creating distance fast is a lifesaving opportunity. If a serious chemical spill happens nearby, creating distance with a vehicle might be a good idea. Clouds drift slowly, can take minutes to hours.

A building does NOT automatically protect you against chemical gasses/weapons.

### 3. Capture / Kidnapping - Survival Strategies

* Stay aware: Avoid dangerous situations when possible.
* Keep calm: Stress and panic increase risk of injury.
* Observe captors: Note routines, weaknesses, exits, or potential help.
* Small compliance: **Avoid provoking captors**; cooperate, pick safe moments to act. Even staring can make captors feel uneasy about you.
* Signal discreetly: If possible, leave traces, marks, or notes to indicate location or condition. (you maybe be punished if discovered)

### 4. Digital Safety - Smartphone Precautions

* Remove sensitive info: Do not store photos, symbols, or documents related to your identity, nationality, or affiliations. (no national emblems, flags, group affiliations) Act neutral.
* If you contacted your government, instantly erase the e-mail, sms, chat, phonecall or text message. (they might assume you are related to the government when captured)
* Use strong passwords: Enable device encryption.
* Offline storage: Keep backups on secure USBs or encrypted SD cards.
* Minimal connectivity: Turn off location tracking and unnecessary network access.
* Use secure communication: Offline-prepared VPN or encrypted messaging apps when needed.

### 5. Emergency Documents - What to Carry & How to Store

* Essential papers: ID/passport, medical info, insurance, emergency contacts, property records.
* Digital copies: Store encrypted on USB or offline device.
* Physical backup: Laminated copies or waterproof bags.
* Organization: Keep in a single, accessible folder labeled clearly.
* Update regularly: Every 6-12 months or after major life changes.

### 6. Shelter - Locations, Tips & Preparation

* Identify nearest shelters: Public bunkers, basements, or secure indoor areas.
* Check structural safety: Avoid unstable buildings.
* Stock essentials: Water, food, first aid, flashlight, communication devices.
* Rotation plan: Know exit routes and alternative shelters.
* Noise and light discipline: Avoid attracting attention during conflict situations.
* Avoid derelict / vacant / empty buildings at all costs. **They may be structurally unsafe or contain mines, traps, boobytraps or harbour enemy troups.**

### 7. General Survival Advice - First Aid, Water, Food, Communication

* First aid: Keep a basic kit, know CPR and bleeding control, treat injuries promptly.
* Water: Carry purification tablets, filters, or boil water before drinking.
* Food: High-calorie, non-perishable rations; rotate supply regularly.
* Communication: Use radios, offline maps, signal mirrors, whistles, or pre-arranged check-ins.
* Stay calm: Planning and methodical actions save more lives than haste or panic.
