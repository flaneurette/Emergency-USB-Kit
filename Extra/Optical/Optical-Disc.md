# Optical Disc Storage for Long-Term Archival

If you want long-lasting cold storage with a lifespan of 10-1000 years, I would recommend burning a DVD, Blu-ray, or M-DISC. Among these options, **M-DISC** lasts the longest.

**Downside:** You'll need an optical reader in the future for retrieval.

## Comparison Table

| Media Type | Lifespan | Technology | Best For |
|------------|----------|------------|----------|
| Standard DVD | 5-10 years | Organic dye layer | Short-term backup |
| Standard Blu-ray | 10-25 years | Organic dye layer | Medium-term storage |
| M-DISC (DVD) | 1000+ years | Inorganic rock-like layer | Long-term archival |
| M-DISC (Blu-ray) | 1000+ years | Inorganic rock-like layer | Long-term archival with higher capacity |

**Why M-DISC stands out:** M-DISC uses a rock-like layer instead of organic dyes, making it highly resistant to degradation from light, temperature, and humidity. The claimed 1000-year lifespan is based on ISO/IEC testing, far exceeding standard DVDs or Blu-rays.

**The main challenge:** Reader availability in the future - the "digital dark age" problem. In 50+ years, optical drives might be rare or obsolete.

**Strategies to mitigate this:**

- Store a USB optical drive with the discs as relatively cheap insurance (include drivers!)
- Use common formats - Blu-ray M-DISCs are more likely to have legacy support than proprietary formats
- Maintain multiple copies across different media types - don't put all your eggs in one basket
- Perform periodic migration every 10-20 years by copying to whatever the current stable format is

**Bottom line:** For critical archival needs like family photos, legal documents, or research data, M-DISC is worth the investment. The discs are more expensive than regular optical media and require a compatible burner, but for true cold storage it's hard to beat the durability-to-cost ratio.
